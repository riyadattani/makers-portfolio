# I can program fluently

##### Reflect: What does it mean to be able to program fluently?

The ability to translate a specification/user story into functional code in a reasonable time period.

The skills / processes to do this:

- Plan, analyse and model a domain
- Understanding of core concepts of programming:
  - Classes, objects
  - Single Responsibility Principle
  - Encapsulation
  - Test driven development
- Ability to apply these programming concepts to a language or know how to implement them in an unfamiliar language
- A way to unblock yourself when you are stuck:
  - Excellent debugging process
  - Efficiently ‘Googling’ things and being aware of good resources
  - Timeboxing the time you spend on a problem before changing your approach
- Utilizing tools in an optimal way so that you can implement your ideas into code easily
  - For example, using features in an editor to make make you a more efficient coder


##### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

- A code challenge in an unfamiliar language

**Q: Can you program fluently? YES**

##### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)

- [Thermostat](https://github.com/riyadattani/thermostat_JS)
  - Checked out other javascript code and familiarised myself with the syntax of the code and patterns
  - Completed Fizzbuzz in javascript using jasmine as the testing framework
  - Test drove thermostat and researching any unfamiliar syntax such as looping in Javascript
  - Understood what the interface.js file is used for. Researched and implemented jquery and events
  - WHEN STUCK:
    - I researched the error message first and then checked that my test makes sense.
    - Then I looked at examples of similar tests and what passes the code.
    - I timeboxed implementing a solution before looking at an alternative approach.
    - Once I repeated this approach 3 times, I would take a break or seek help to guide me in the right direction.


- Notes app in JS
  - Familiar with the syntax after accomplishing thermostat but worked on more complex concepts in Javascript
  - Learned about the scope of ‘this’ in Javascript
  - Read documentation provided by makers pills and understood the concept of exporting a module
  - Implemented [this](https://github.com/riyadattani/note_JS/blob/master/note-list-view-model.js) module pattern

##### What feedback have you had?

_Sam Morgan (Head coach at Makers)_ You got set-up via the command-line super-quickly. You were using `touch` to set up the required le structure, which was nice. When passing your second test, you introduced a conditional branch. This is de nitely one approach, but I'd argue that although it's "easy", it's more complex a step to introduce a conditional branch to your program (doubling the number of execution paths) than simply returning the given input unchanged. I liked that you played with the program in the REPL to get a picture of how it should function.

_Pairing feedback from Paul Martin_, “I really enjoyed our pairing session yesterday. You were doing most of the typing as we were covering material I was already fairly comfortable with, but you kept up a high level of concentration and engagement over the whole session - impressive when we you were dealing with lots of new concepts! As a result I felt like we’d covered a lot of ground by the end of the afternoon, and we’d got there together.

The material we were dealing with, the module and constructor/prototype patterns in JavaScript, was new to you, and I think you found the concepts hard to ‘get’ at first. But we implemented them a number of times over the afternoon and by the end you had clearly got the hang of the patterns, and were creating new modules and constructors like a boss, with no need to use the references. ”
