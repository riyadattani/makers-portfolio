# I use an agile product development process

##### Reflect: What does it mean to be use an agile product development process?
Agile development is an iterative process on incremental goals worked on collaboratively.

Typical features of an Agile process:
- Careful planning: ensure each member of the team understands the tasks and goals of the project
- Sprints: a sprint is a short period of time (e.g. 2 weeks in the workplace) to implement a set of features as a team
- Set short tasks that collectively reach the larger project goal
- Minimum viable product (MVP): start with building the most simplistic version of the final end-goal product
- Communicate with stakeholders to rectify incorrect assumptions and solidify the future development of the product
- Stand-ups:
  - Team meetings to recap on what has been done and what there is to do
  - Short and objective meetings to unblock any blockers and set goals for the day
- Retrospectives:
  - Take out time to reflect after chunks of work
  - A chance to give and receive feedback that can be used for continual improvement
- Strong and streamlined team ethics:
  - Communication (XP Values), good communication across the supply chain (stakeholders, project leader etc)
  - Respect and awareness of different types of personalities
  - Courageous and honest with personal goals and team goals
- Organisation:
  - Prioritise tasks systematically
  - Skill of estimating tasks well through the complexity of a ‘ticket’ not the amount of time it will take to complete it
- Knowledge sharing: update team members with new things learned by keeping a log of it


##### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

- Work in sprints
- Successfully design an MVP
- Adhere to daily stand-ups and retros after sprints
- Equal contribution towards the project from each member of the team
- Estimation of tasks based on complexity not on time

**Q: Do you use an agile product development process? YES**

##### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)

_Makersbnb_ - first exposure to agile processes
- Daily stand ups and retros after sprints - worked in 3 day sprints
- Talk about how towards the end of the project, things were stressful and the work was not evenly spread out - reflected on this and improved in the next team project
- Made decision as a team as to which technology we should use to produce this web-app: started with Javascript and collectively decided to switch to Ruby. We did this with a vote!

_Acebook_
- Daily stand-ups and retros after sprints - 3 day sprints. Used Trello board to keep track of tasks for each sprint
- Learned to use Github effectively to keep team members on the same page - reviewed each others work before being pushed onto github
- Regularly swapped pairs, mobbed and diverged and converged to solve problems
- No personality clashes and good communication between team members (even went to the cinema)
- Implemented all additional features requested from the stakeholder (Michael)
- Communicated back to Michael to confirm the detailed criteria of a feature - the date of the post

_Raspberry Pi project_(final project)
- Daily stand ups and retros after sprints. Estimated tasks on trello board and actively kept track of tasks
- Code review by other members of the team before pushing into github
- Mobbed and paired with different team members on different parts of the project so that everyone gets a feel of the whole product
- After achieving MVP and finishing the sprint, had feedback from Wardah to improve our agile process by switching pairs more often - changed process and worked on this during 2nd sprint
- Knowledge sharing - used wiki on Github share anything new we learned
- Iteratively added features to the product - changed architecture of code to be much more modular in the 2nd sprint

##### What feedback have you had?

_Sam Morgan (Head coach at Makers)_ Great job asking for specifications and criteria, especially using an analogy of a dictionary. You asked for specifc examples, which gave us an opportunity to talk about acceptance criteria. 

_Team retro at the end of MakersBnb_ “We lost our agile processes towards the end of the week. Riya and Kim were stuck in the logic and backend work while Arthur and Harry were focusing on the user interface and design of the website. In future projects we reflected that we should switch pairs regularly and knowledge share any knew learnings.”

_Kim on Acebook_ “Our team exemplified and lived out the Agile manifesto - we showed each other respect, we adopted Agile processes and we had fun along the way and learnt loads. Most importantly, we put people and communication over the process, which is at the heart of what Agile was all about. Our focus on people meant we were able to bring out the best in everyone to complete all of our features, as well as bonus features to meet the business acceptance criteria to a professional level.”
