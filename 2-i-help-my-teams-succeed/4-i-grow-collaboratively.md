# I grow collaboratively

##### Reflect: What does it mean to grow collaboratively?

- Give and take constructive feedback. This will only improve your efficiency, another team members efficiency and hence the teams efficiency
- Knowledge sharing within team members is key and likewise seeking knowledge.
- Communicate effectively and clearly. Be aware of different personality types and liaise accordingly
- Create a good relationship with your pairing partner to ease any discomfort/awkwardness at first

##### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal
- Contribute to a wiki page with new learnings to share knowledge
- Switch pairs regularly in a team project so that everyone is comfortable with different parts of the app

**Q: Do you grow collaboratively? YES**

##### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)

- Raspberry Pi project [wiki](https://github.com/riyadattani/weather_station_server/wiki/Code-climate-coverage-configuration-on-.travis.yml-file)
  - I wrote a wiki on configuring code climate on the travis.yml file specifically for Javascript
  - I had to research how to do this and so once i figured it out, I shared it with other team members
- Acebook:
  - As a team we mobbed to work on using the devise gem. Once this was in development, we split into pairs and worked on separate features. The next day we made it a point to switch pairs and work on another part of the app
  - By the end of the project, I was fairly comfortable with every part of the project

##### What feedback have you had?

_Kim on Acebook_“At a coding level, Riya's suggestion of diverge-converge was useful. This meant when faced with a technical blocker, our team would 'mob' to get the technical foundations in place, whilst being mindful to enable the space for individual learning and exploration. Riya can get stuck into a technical problem and come back to the team with groundbreaking implementation. She would be an asset to any Agile team who is looking for that outside-the-box thinking. She was able to bring everyone together and show her approach to help others grow collaboratively. Riya was able to work across the whole tech stack - full-stack!”
