# I can justify the way I work in a business context

##### Reflect: What does it mean to justify the way you work in a business context?

- Ability to design a business logic model that satisfies the stakeholder
- Make decisions on priorities and features based on the constraints you have such as time and resources
- If assumptions are made, validate them by showing how they reach the objective
- Always refer back to the product owner to check you are on track


##### Plan: List evidence you aim to collect that would together show you have credibly achieved this goal

- Experience of liaising with the product owner/ stakeholder

**Q: Can you justify the way you work in a business context? YES**

##### Reflect: How does each of the following examples of your best work show evidence of achieving this goal? (e.g. Diode projects, Github repos)

_Acebook_
- Regularly checking in with Michael to check he is happy with the features we implemented
- Liaised with Michael to confirm the details regarding [this trello task](https://trello.com/c/uYooDIlX) -  we confirmed the date time setting for each post, we do not need to update the time if the post has been updated

##### What feedback have you had?

_Michael (Coach)_ said that he liked how Kim and I confirmed our tasks and encouraged us to ask him any questions for clarifications as it is worse to revoke them at a later stage.
